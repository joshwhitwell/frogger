## Objective
Recreate the classic 1891 arcade action game, [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), using only HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

## MVP
1. Game board must consist of at least five lanes (excluding start and finish lane), a game piece to serve as Frogger, and an indicator of the current score.
2. Each lane (excluding start and finish lane) must contain at least one obstacle.
3. Each obstacle must continuously move parallel across its respective lane.
4. Player must be able to move Frogger around the game board by using the keyboard arrow keys.
5. Player must not be able to move Frogger more than one space at a time.
6. At the start of the game, Frogger must be located behind the starting line, and the current score must be 0.
7. If an obstacle touches Frogger at any point, he must be returned to the starting position.
8. If Frogger successfully crosses the finish line, the current score must be incremented by 1 and Frogger must be returned to the starting position.

## Bonus
1. Add a custom theme to your game. For example, instead of a road and cars, make the gameboard a river with crocodiles to serve as obstacles.
2. Implement a "lives" feature whereby the player has a set number of attempts to reach the finish line, after which "Game Over."
3. Add a difficult setting that the player can choose on start. For example, setting a harder difficulty could introduce more obstacles to the game board.
